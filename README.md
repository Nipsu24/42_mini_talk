## About
The repository contains files for creating two executables (./server and ./client) which can communicate with each other by utelising signals.

## Program
Launching the server executable presents a `PID` in the terminal which can be used as first argument for the client executable which in turn
needs to be launched in a second terminal window. The second argument for the ./client is the message which should be transferred to the server (if writing sentences, the whole arguement 
needs to be put into quotes `" "`. Also emojis are supported.  
The program makes use of several signal function of the C signal library


## Requirements
- `gcc` compiler

## Instructions

### 1. Compiling the program

To compile the two executables, navigate into the repo folder and run:

```
$ make 
```

### 2. Launch server

Start the server and check the PID on the terminal.
```
$ ./server
```

### 3. Launch client

Start the client by inserting the command below in a second terminal window (the PID needs to match with the one displayed by the server)
```
$ ./client <PID> <"message">
```
The message will appear in the terminal window of the server. The client terminal window in turn shows every bit transfer to the server for this message.
